# *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Employee Attrition*

Welcome to the *Employee Attrition EDA* repository! This project aims to explore and analyze the *Employee Attrition* dataset to uncover key insights, clean the data, and prepare it for further machine learning tasks.

---

## *Overview*  
This repository contains all the steps I followed to perform an advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Employee Attrition dataset. The process includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and identifying patterns and trends to understand why employees leave the company.

## *What's Inside?*  
- **notebooks/**  
  - EDA.ipynb: A complete walkthrough of the EDA process. It covers data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizing key insights.  
- **data/**  
  - raw_data.csv: The original dataset with no modifications.  
  - cleaned_data.csv: The cleaned version of the dataset, ready for analysis or further modeling.  
- **visualizations/**  
  - Various visualizations (heatmaps, pair plots, KDE plots) generated during the analysis.  
- **src/**  
  - data_cleaning.py: Scripts to handle missing values and outlier detection.  
  - feature_engineering.py: Scripts to create new features and transform the dataset.

## *Tools Used*  
The analysis was done using the following tools:  
- *Python* for all analysis and data manipulation.  
- *Pandas* for cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data.  
- *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* for creating informative and visually appealing plots.
